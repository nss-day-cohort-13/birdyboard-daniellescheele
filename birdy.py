# I am still organizing and planning my code before testing and implementation.
# In my planning, I have built a main menu that prompts a user to enter a choice for what they want to do ( based on the main menu in the requirements)
# The user's choice will be stored in a variable and will then continue to a specific set of 'if' statements based on the user's choice
#   example.... if user chooses menu option 1 their choice will prompt a new set of prompts to answer
#   each menu option has at least one additional set of prompts needed to continue to the desired destination
#  for now, I thought I will have a text file for all private chirps and a txt file for all public chirps
# I want to complete thinking through my code before writing my tests and then my implemtation code
